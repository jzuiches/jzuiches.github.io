      <h4>How a computer works</h4>
<p><em></em></p>
<p>The first most important part about a computer is that is uses bits. Tons and tons of bits. A bit is has two states in computers that is on or off. Or maybe the better way to think of it is that electricity is present or not in a single, very small location. These singular locations for electricity can be hooked together to form gates. The three main types of gates are the AND gate, the NAND gate and the NOT gate. These gates change the presence of electricity depending on the state of the two locations sent in.  NAND means (not and) and this gate takes two on states and returns an off state. An AND gate does the opposite it takes two on states and returns an on state and a NOT gate takes two on states and return an off state.THe mildly not intuitive part of this is that it really isn't a gate in that it is a devise letting or not letting a pulse of electricity go through a place. The output has it's own source of electricity.  The electricity does not "flow" through this mechanical gate because we just said with the NAND gate if the input bits are off, which means that there is no electricity than the output gate is on. So these can be thought of as logical gates that have an input state and an output state strictly depending on the input states.</p>
<p> One of the most basic parts of a computer is a bit of memory. A bit of memory is a configuration of three NAND gates connected by three wires. These wires enter the configuration as an input wire an output and a set wire. The configuration creates a situation that passes one bit from through the memory from input to output when the set wire is on. When the set wire is off the output is what ever was it's previous state and cannot be affected by the on/off state of the input.  <image scr= "images/bit_of_memory.jpg">
