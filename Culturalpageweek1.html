      <h3>Cultural post 1 - Kitchen vs. Table</h3>
      <p>I loved the kitchen vs. table analogy for education. I am excited to get to DBC and work at creating something great and experiencing the incredible learning environment.</p>
      <p>I am expecting that it will push me further than I can imagine. Just the first week has pushed me to my limit.  I have been out of school for a long time and DBC seems like just about the only place I might fit in.  The biggest fear is that I will just fall flat on my face.  With how little I know and how eduction in the end always feels like a race I just wonder if there are enough hours in the day for me to even keep up. But back to the kitchen analogy, it gives me hope that there is a space for even me in DBC. I very well may be the worst in the class but I'm still gonna give in my all.</p>
