      <h3>Technical post 1   3 Websites</h3>
      <p><ol>Google</ol>
        <p>Google seems like a very user friendly website to me.  It has very little distractions with only two things that draw your eye, the logo and the search bar.</p>
        <p>The beauty of google is it's simplicity but it seems in order to have that simplicity it needs to have a lot of power. By that I mean, that other websites give you options, places that they can take you.  Where as Google asks you, what are you looking for? Now that's the nature of the site but also the nature of the ideas behind it.</p>
        <ol>YouTube</ol>
        <p>YouTube is just a great concept and the creation of a whole new way to move knowledge and entertainment around.  You literally can learn anything on YouTube and do it without picking up a book.  It is changing future generations for better and for worse.  Visually it seems like over the years its getting more and more cluttered like so many sites.  They are trying to give you the customer everything you could ever want and everything you didn't know you wanted but unconsciously do.  Ads seem like they are the downside to many good designs.</p>
        <ol>Yahoo</ol>
        <p>Yahoo is another site that is the starting point for so much information but it does it in the exact opposite way as Google.  Ii is littered with links to other yahoo sites and scolling pictures and the works.  But I do think it works as a site.  Easily navigated and nicely laid out. I tend to bounce around in there multiple sites for a while everyday not because they are the best finance or sports sites but because they are easy to find.
