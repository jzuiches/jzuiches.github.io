      <h4>Stereotype Threat</h4>
      <p>Stereotype threat is related to a person's identity and in particular to a person's social identity. The social identity is the group for which a person feels a part of and that feeling of being a part of that group plays a relevent part in different circumstances that the person finds themselves. The ways in which one's identity is relavent to certian circustances is called identity contingencies. Identity is situational.  The relevance of a certian identity is tied to the social structure and other aspects that makes being a member of that group very relavent or not. When a persons identity is threatened that is when it is felt the greatest.  This can be felt when you are the only member of a group within a situation.  Your personal identity gets tied to that of the group from which you are the only representative. The sense of a threat because of one's identity reinforces the identity.</p>
      <p>Stereotype threat is an identity contingency and therefore because it is a threat is fundemental in identity. Stereotype threat is being in a situation in which one of your negative identities could be applied to you. If you believe that one of your identities is applicable to the situation you also usually have a belief that you could be judged in terms of that identity. If you care about what you are doing in that situation that belief that you may be negatively judged can interfere with your ability to function in that situation. The "threat" is that fear that judgement will arise in that situation. The fear and frustration that arise in that situation in a sense rationalizes the stereotype that the person already identifies with and gives it more power. It becomes a selfufilling stereotype.  Frustration is a key ingredient to seeing you identity as being relavent to the situation.  Frustration leads to the questioning of why am I frustrated, which leads to a rationalizing of an understood stereotype. Caring is related to this frustration and is also a key ingredient in these identity contingencies. It seems like caring in its effort to fight against the stereotype also leads the sterrotype to play a larger role. The example is woman that care very deeply about doing well at math will feel with the greater intensity the stereotypes that they are biologically deficient at math.  The method of repressing the feelings for a certian subject are a way of diffusing that conflict between what is cared for and the prevalent stereotype.</p>
      <p> There are also very prominent physiological effects that appear as stress from the threat.  These physiological effects are not felt subjectively but do effect the performance of the individual.  Social cues are what sets these effects in motion. For example, intelligence is hindered by these effects when the cues are that the person is being tested on their intelligence whereas if the situation is reframed as a different activity these effects may not be seen.</p>
      <p>These social cues can cause the stress reaction that can be referred to as vigilence and add to a sense of not belonging.  A sense of not belonging creates the feeling of being judged. The good news from this research is that small positive cues can create a situation where all other social cues and historical understandings are the same but the situation can be seen as less threatening.</p>
      <p> This research is resolved in a person dimension in so many ways. It seems to relate to the fixed mindset that I wrote about in an earlier blog. The feeling of a threat to my own identity and therefore a shying away from it in an attempt to protect that identity.  Most of that threat come with from an identity related to intelligence and privilenge. The threat felt from priviledge is that you don't know and can never have experienced real life affirming and forming struggle.  This threat is usually given by cues from other generations as well as other groups within the society.  The intelligence threats come from all aspects of schooling after a person has been labeled as intelligent.  In order to maintain that label because of its percieved value a fixed mindset may be applied and endeavors that threaten that perception which could be almost all scholastic endeavor are avoided to avoid the threat.</p>
      <p>The idea of feedback as a basic way to overcome this stereotype threat will be an important aspect of on site training. Claude M. Steele mentions trust as an important part of meaningful feedback.  Trust is gained by seeing potential in a persons work as opposed to seeing the potential in a person for whom the identities and stereotypes are intimately tied.  So the feedback seems to have to be of the A.S.K model. Kind so that one can have some hope in the protential of one's work but also specific so that it's scope is understood as more or less objective and not debilitating to the person's sense of identity.</p>
      <p>I think an easy way to make an enviroment more wlecoming is to be open about your own emotions through a situation so that it others can relate to it. An example so far in all the pairing sessions is to be explicit about the difficulties I've had and the solutions I've found as opposed to making an effort to hide difficulties to maintain an image of great natural ability.  This latter method would intimidate and isolate both people</p>
