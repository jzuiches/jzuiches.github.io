  <h2>There Are No Stupid Questions?</h2>
  <h2>On the Art of Asking a Question</h2>
    <p>The always profoundly encouraging but naive assertion that "there are no stupid questions" poses the problem and complexity of questions and questioning. The question qua question reveals the internal world of the questioner as well as the internal world of the answerer.  The collateral effect to the and from the listener cannot be forgotten or eliminated in this analysis either.</p>
    <p>  The definition of stupid versus bad has to be assessed as well and is where the negation really lies. There are bad question or confused and confusing questions but stpid is too subjective and perjorative a word to be used to describe an act that is so self revealing, so conspicuous.  That revelation of not-knowing to others is what can cause the threat to the questioner.  A common method of dealing with this threat is the use of subtle retorical questions. Questions that illicit a known answer that will inform the audience as well as the answerer the the questioner is well informed of this topic and can parry with the official expert. These are necessarily not good questions as the intent and spirit of the question is not for revelatory purposes which I would argue is the true purpose of a question, good or bad.</p>
    <p> This purpose of revealing although metaphorical seems to me to strike at the heart of what it is to question. The question lies at a special place. It lies at a margin between known and unknown. But it also contains within it the seeds of the answer. It contains the structural resemblances to the answer in order to elicit or bring forth that which it is groping for.</p>
    <p> I think I will stop with the philosophizing about the nature of questions and get to so solid argument for the elements of "good" questions. The first element of a good question is that it should be specific. That in a sence it should walk the answerer down the path of understanding until the point of not understanding is reached. This will give the answerer the ability to follow a train of thought to see 1) whether the train of thought may have diverged earlier than the questioner had believed or 2) That the train of thought or logical progession was sound and that the question points in the correct direction for the answerer to reveal the appropriate landscape out in front. The second part of asking a good question is that the grammer and spelling is correct.  The ability of the answerer to comprehend the question correctly is vital to geting the answer you were looking for.  This problem can also arrive from an inablility to be specific because of deep and large scope mis or lack of understanding on the part of the questioner.</p>
    <p> What most of these sites seem to say is create a good title question. This will bring in the people with the answers. Show that you have done some work in an attempt to figure out exactly what the question or problem is and then put some effort into formatting and spelling. Unlike this blog</p>
    <p>Here are some sample questions from Stack Overflow:</p>

    <p><strong>How do I Quit IRB from the command line? (Using terminal on mac)</strong></p>
    Basically, I'm typing along just fine in terminal, using IRB to run ruby commands:</p>


<p><pre>2.0.0-p0 :014 > bank_account.withdraw(2222)
 => -1222
But sometimes I accidentally miss out a quotation mark.

2.0.0-p0 :020 > BankAccount.create_for("Jim","Johnson)
2.0.0-p0 :021"> bank_account.withdraw(333)
If you look carefully, you'll see that the speech mark I missed out appears next to the line number on the left, next to the patch version.

From here on in, that speech mark appears everytime I run a command! And it stops the commands working:

2.0.0-p0 :021"> BankAccount.create_for("Julian","Hurley")
2.0.0-p0 :022"> BankAccount.create_for("Katt","Smith")
2.0.0-p0 :023"> exec($0)
What I want to know is, how do I get rid of that quotation mark? Or quit IRB from the command line in order to reset it?</pre></p>
<p>I believe this is a good question. The title is specific and it also tells what kind of terminal is being used. Then is slowly goes through the code and uses actual code to explain how the person got to the problem in the first place. They do a nice breaking the code up and placing what amounts to comments in between the code and points out the irregularities. Then at the end he states the problem. </p>
