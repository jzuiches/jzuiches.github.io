      <h3>Technical post 4</h3>
      <h4>Enumerable?</h4>
<p>Enumerable is a module and enumerator is a class and like most technical sentences I have to define two more words in order to define the first. "A module is a way of grouping together methods, classes and constants". Ok, that doesn't give me much and it begs the question, what exactly is a class? Since I'm going to assume that my readers understand what a method is and what is a constant. Especially since my reader is, well, me. The second part of the module definition is  "Modules provide a namespace and prevent name clashes.
Modules implement the mixin facility.".  So with that we have two more concepts to understand, namespace and mixin facility. So far this is our outline for understanding</p>
<ul>
  <li>Enumerable</li>
  <ul><li>module</li>
    <ul><li>namespace</li>
      <li>mixin facility</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>Enumerator</li>
  <ul><li>class</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>Here we go back to namespaces. So as a programmer writes more and more code. That programmer usually like to save little chunks of code as a method or I suppose other things, maybe as a constant. These little chunks of code get saved individually to be used on other programs later. Because I've been told that a lazy programmer is a good programmer and noone wants to solve a logic problem twice! These files can be grouped together in what is called a library. These libraries, if the programmer is somewhat organized will usually be code files that do similar things, or I suppose, organized anyway he/she wants.  Ruby does this already by having the Class designation. It creates a hierarchy and says "these things kinda go together, lets call them a class".  Now namespace is created by creating more of these hierarchies because you could have chunks of code named the same thing but if you have it under a different hierarchy than they will remain different things.  One way to do this is to divide like named code into modules. Modules have methods just like classes but they are different, if only in name.</p>
<p> Onto mixins:
Mixins bring up the question of instance methods. Which almost instantly brings us back to classes. A class is a "blueprint for creating objects".  When I think of blueprint I think of rules or atleast an abstraction from the thing (object) to something less substantial. So objects are created and destroyed in the computers memory but the structure of what is to be called an object is determined by is class. So it seems that a class has both static and non-static variables. The static ones and the class itself fill a part of the computer's memory.  Within a class a constructor subroutine(another word to look up) creates as many shortlived objects as it needs these are called instance variables because the are instances of the orginal class.
