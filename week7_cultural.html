      <h4>On Values</h4>
      <p>This post is on values. A subject that is near and dear to my heart. The first question is what two or three values did you most identify with during a happy or proud or satisfying time in your life.</p>
      <p>The two for me that I hold most dear are enthusiam and adventure. I hold these two as being really inspirational to me, atleast today, or tonight for that matter. Both of these values are bold in the face of a rather bleak world. Enthusiasm is about love and passion and excitement. Some other values on the value list that I'm attempting to wrap into one. Adventure has some of these same intuitive meanings but with the added sense of freedom, overcoming and self-reliance.  What I like best about these values is they pull out strength in me that I sometimes can't find otherwise. I heard one time that the way to overcome a passion is with a stronger passion.  Enthusiasm is the manifestation of that stronger passion. One has to give into it though and that can be the hard part. The amount that it gives to you can only be multiplied by what you give to it. It is easy to squash enthusiasm by pressures and threats from the outside or inside of oneself.  True love pulls at you until you embrace it or gnaws at you as you push it away.  Enthusiasm, is the "yes" saying to what you love.  Adventure is how you find what you love. The two for me go hand in hand.  Although as I said above your true love can save you if you have it and destroy you if you push it away it is adventure that seeks and finds that love.  That takes you to places within and outside of yourself that have at one point called to you from inside yourself and at the same time show you what is beyond yourself. But it feels like I'm getting off the point.</p>
      <p>The third question of this blog is do you in general try to live up to these values? I don't really think I do. So I ould be on the 2 or 3 of the scale of 1 (doesn't live up to) and 5(absolutely lives up to). I don't find myself all that enthusiastic about things or that enthusiasm wears off very quickly.  Or I find myself enthusiastic about things that I only loath later on.  Enthusiasm sees to me quite an effort.  Not that it shouldn't be but sometime the effort makes you question that thing you are being enthusiastic about but there again it may be teaching me something. The quest is not over. As far as adventure I have streaks but with both I seem to need an impetus and that usually is another person. But other people almost always make the adventure better.</p>
      <p>The next question of this blog is: What was the last thing someone asked your advise about? And how does it relate to your values?  I can't say I get asked advise all that much. But when I do my usual stock answer is similar to the above statements about my values and so you can see why people don't usually come back for more advice.  I like to ramble on about reciprocity in all things about changing your heart as opposed to will power or control about love and passion and invisible power in the world. That's the kinda crap advise I give. The kinda advise you come away thinking you're either dumber than when you started listening or think "man I wish he would just be straight and not try to confound things to try to encompass every possibility".  Possibly it is advice given out of fear.</p>
      <p>The last question is about values and stereotype threat. There is an assumption that reflecting on your values will usurp the threat. The first question is: How do you feel when you think about your values?  I feel a bit of love and hate when I think about my values. I feel waves of claustaphobia and freedom. I feel sometimes my values are the very chains that bind me.  Anyway...lets get back to stereotype threat because its awesome. Stereotype threat if I remember correctly from last week is your sense of identity that feels threatened in a circumstance where a part of your identity feels most vulnerable. That's usually where you care deepest about the circumstance and it's relation to your identity. The example in the lecture was the woman who was deeply invested in math, taking a math exam. The stereotype that might be most most threatening to her is that women aren't good at math and that threat is proportional to how much she cares about the subject of math how much of her life she has invested in it and how much hope she has put into the future. So now she feels like it is her against the world. The world has created these stereotypes. It is the world that has created the oppression and past circumstances that perpetuate this burden. And if there is anything "the world" doesn't like its somebody trying to rock the boat. (But maybe that is my stereotype about "the world").</p>
      <p>The next question for the blog, although I'm not sure I answered the last one, is: Do you think you can mediate stereotype threat by recognizing it? I think absolutely. I'll go out on a limb and say that anytime you recognize a threat it helps to mediate it but that's not the end I think the question of values has to come in and defeat it. It is now a "known known" in Rumsfeld speak but it has yet to be defeated.</p>
      <p> The last question is what exercise (mental or physical) would you do if you feel down at DBC. I always go for a run. Physical exercise is the best method I've found for dealing with the "downs" of the day or week or month. It reinvigerates me and gives me hope.</p>
