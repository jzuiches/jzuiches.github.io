      <h4>What's so great about Javascript?</h4>
<p>I give that answer a try.  Javascript is great for lots of reasons and one of the big ones is that it's been around for a while.  It was implimented at the early stages of the web so it has some history. With that history comes a lot of baggage, again some good and some bad.  The good aspects of a long history is the incredible amount of books, tutorials, advice, libraries and open source code that is available with Javascript.  The bad news is that what once was funky about javascript only becomes more irritating with time. But lets stay on the bright side for a bit longer.  With its history comes a legacy and that can be seen in its use on all browsers. Now browsers can interpret it differently and that may be a downside but it is what gives our webpages so much animation and life. Without javascript you would just have lazy, boring, but pretty, html and css pages. Another good thing that is associated with it's legacy but also the way it was designed was that it's on the client-side of the network.  Now there is another side of javascript but the client-side adds lots of speed and capability to Javascript. But my favorite part about javascript is that it has very little to do with Java.  I read that it was mostly a marketing gimmick trying to ride the coat tales of the big popular progamming language at the time Java. I think that's just great!</p>
<p> Ok. Back to Javascript.  What is javascript? Javascript is a lightweight, object oriented language. Huh? Lightweight seems to mean not terribly verbose.  Programs can be written that are short but can accomplish something nonetheless.  A heavy language would be Java.  It takes more lines of code to get the same thing done.  Object oriented seems to mean at least in a contrasting sense to be opposed to functional.  Object oriented the object is the building block vs. the function. But back to the original question, javascript is a programming language for the web. It tells browsers and the web what to do. Like I said before it runs on server side and browser side.  So it tells the server how to do things with the web, this is what js.node is used for, and then on the other side it tell browsers what to do with webpages and the web. This creates its rich interactive experience. Some examples of the richness that javascript gives to a webpage are slideshows, social media abilities, most buttons that give you more than just a new webpage like a sign in buttom.  Javascript has taken over in this realm in the last couple years what was done by flash.  The reason for this take over is because javascript has done a better job being implimented on mobile devices. Some examples of the richness that javascript gives to a webpage are slideshows, social media abilities, most buttons that give you more than just a new webpage like a sign in buttom.
