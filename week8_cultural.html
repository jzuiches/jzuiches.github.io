      <h4>On Conflict</h4>
      <p>Conflict avoidance is an ability that I've honed fairly well. But it seems that conflict avoidance can be as damaging as conflict itself. Maybe the healthiest way is conflict resolution.  That being a beautiful word that trips off the tongue as though points have been made smooth all contradictions have been logically straightened out and the two in conflict have seen their humanity in a new light of brotherhood and equality.  It's beautiful and exists for about as long as the thought that gave it life. That is a couple heart beats, new sense of the air or smell or a change in their visual field.<p>
        <p>The first part of this exercise was the review of the compass of shame.  The compass of shame gave four clusters of behaviors that are descibed as way, immature ways, of dealing with shame. It is given an evolutionary origin and meaning in the article. Defining shame as a way to take on the burden of something without separating yourself from the community. A life without shame would be a noncommunal one because shame is a product of the other and the outgrowth of a shared meaning and therefore a possibility for conflict. So when there is conflict how is shame dealt with? In one of the many unhealthy ways mentioned in the shame compass or is it dealt with more maturely?<p>
          <p> I recently had a conflict at work. The conflict was a conflict in goals.  The idea and approach of a large project was based on these goals. I think that both he and I had reasonable positions and maybe the conflict was really about communicating our ideas and positions without emotional possession of the position. By that I mean that as people become invested in a position it becomes bound to themselves and the sense of themselves. This is starting to sound like stereotype threat.  But as people "run" with an idea that idea becomes a point of conflict because of what the invested more that an 'objective' conflict of 'meaning'.  By that I mean small contradictions within two positions are blown into large conflicts.  The threat is felt not from true opposed views or beliefs but just from investment in one specific way. Again like stereotype threat it becomes attached to the self and it is felt like an attack on something much deeper than the position held. Sometimes the people only realize the position the hold because of the emotional reaction it evokes. They didn't "know" they felt this way and other times aren't really conscious of the first threads of conflict. The depth of it creates an internal wonderland that the mind inhabits while the outward behavior and consciousness prepare for the fight.</p>
          <p>The conflict was handled dismissively. I had very little power in that relationship or atleast I didn't want to exert power maybe as a way to avoid conflict and the onflict was not resolved but walked away from.  Maybe only to resurface later but more likely in my case to be let go completely or if that's not possible to be reformulated in a convoluted blog about conflict.</p>
          <p>I guess my action which was mostly inaction made the situation better. He didn't have to give up anything for me and I secretly don't have to give up anything either.
          <p>I don't know what I would have done different and sometimes wonder about that question. But I guess I would have told him more forcefully and convincingly how and where he was wrong and he would have either had a better and more forceful retort or I would have won and he would then have to choose what to do with himself and this new knowledge.
