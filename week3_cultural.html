<p>I have discovered that I am an Abstract random thinker with a smattering of concrete random in there too.  The abstract random learner it appears is into noncompetitive, social learning environments. It sounds like they have to be coddled a little because they are sensitive.  They like cooperative work and open-ended assignments.  The concrete random prefers hands-on experiences, real, but creative projects and original or unique approaches to problems.  These actually sound like me.  This was the second time I took the test and I think I was more honest at least as far as I can be when evaluating myself, not who I hope or portray myself to be. Below is a conversation with Elon Musk.  Its there as inspiration as much as anything.  He has a mindset and thining ability I very much admire. An ability to dream big but also break problems down. An ability to communicate those ideas and his evaluative process well and an ability to risk everything on an the adventure that is creating and learning.  It is a growth mindset writ large in the world.</p>


<p>  Love the growth mindset. It is a stress free learing environment completely different from school or Devbootcamp or even the real world.  The thing that I feel is wonderful about the growth mindset is that it has a bit of the "follow your bliss" idea to it. Or maybe I'm placing that on top of the concept.  Ihe idea of trying and failing of letting yourself find a rabbit hole to follow and seeing all there is to see down there.  This is the most engrossing way to learn.  Everyone has found this and followed it and enjoyed the process.  The process is like "flow". Another pschological term that people like to use to define a pleasant state of being.  There are a couple elements that I see as impeding this mindset and state of being. First that of time and its relation to productivity. Second is learning as the aquisition and not the recollection of things. Third, as it relates to aquisition, is the comodification of education. Fourth, is the belief that goes with aquisition of the "growth" mindset that the fixed is bad, fundamentally untrue, and is the source of ignorance and therefore every other injustice in the world.

This is how people learn: they are placed in a context also known as an environment.  This environment surrounds their senses with a persuasion and a method.  This environment wants to sustain itself.  Preservation is a correlate to "the good".  It is the being of a place that informs it's existence.  A context or environment's existence is not defined because it is everything that is, it's logical relation to what is not and everything to come before and after.  By being all these things one could inevidably feel "caught".

Why people learn? It's as easy as saying that it's because they choose to and as hard as saying why things are the way they are.

Somethings that I've noticed in DevBootcamp is that I feel best and learn the easiest when I don't feel the stress of time.  I can relax, take my time, reread and not feel like I have to produce something.  The most productive time is right before deadlines.  The last four hours before the due date I get stuff done. I find answers more quickly and stay focused longer.  The most unproductive time is inbetween.  The period where there is the beginnings of a time constraint. I'm projecting how long these challenges are going to take and how many workable hours I have before the deadline. But this period also allows for some procrastination.  It is a period where I don't feel like I can really master the material and produce something of high value.  A period where I'm waiting for the external time pressure to really drive me since my drive for mastery and quality is starting to wane.
