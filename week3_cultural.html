<p> Love the growth mindset. It is a stress free learing environment completely different from school or Devbootcamp or even the real world.  The thing that I feel is wonderful about the growth mindset is that it has a bit of the "follow your bliss" idea to it. Or maybe I'm placing that on top of the concept.  Ihe idea of trying and failing of letting yourself find a rabbit hole to follow and seeing all there is to see down there.  This is the most engrossing way to learn.  Everyone has found this and followed it and enjoyed the process.  The process is like "flow". Another pschological term that people like to use to define a pleasant state of being.  There are a couple elements that I see as impeding this mindset and state of being. First that of time and its relation to productivity. Second is learning as the aquisition and not the recollection of things. Third, as it relates to aquisition, is the comodification of education. Fourth, is the belief that goes with aquisition of the "growth" mindset that the fixed is bad, fundamentally untrue, and is the source of ignorance and therefore every other injustice in the world.

This is how people learn: they are placed in a context also known as an environment.  This environment surrounds their senses with a persuasion and a method.  This environment wants to sustain itself.  Preservation is a correlate to "the good".  It is the being of a place that informs it's existence.  A context or environment's existence is not defined because it is everything that is, it's logical relation to what is not and everything to come before and after.  By being all these things one could inevidably feel "caught".

Why people learn? It's as easy as saying that it's because they choose to and as hard as saying why things are the way they are.
