      <h4>Problems in the Tech World</h4>
      <p>I guess from an article I read that there is an adderall problem in the tech world.  People in order to focus and work long hours are taking adderall to get through the stressful times of product launch and start-up. It says that this is fueled by a culture that embraces the idea of high-pressure and high payoff.  The idea of the 10x engineer that has been around for a while, i guess, is now replaced with the 100x or 100000x engineer and the profitability that goes with it. The model of 10 or 20 engineers building a billion dollar company has become if not the norm atleast a founding myth. This would drive anyone with that vision to push themselves past a certian point to get to the promise land. Past any sense of moderation or patience. Maybe its industry and business in general.  The other aspect of this understanding of the productive power of the engineer is in a change in web development in the last say ten or less years. An interesting article discussed the change in necessary skills for software and web development. It had an interesting quote from Brad Cox</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Mature industries like plumbing are less complex than ours, not because software is intrinsically more complicated, but because they—and not we —have solved their complexity, nonconformity, and changeability problems by using a producer/consumer hierarchy to distribute these problems across time and organizational space. The plumbing supply market lets plumbers solve only the complexities of a single level of the producer/consumer hierarchy without having to think about lower levels, for example, by reinventing pipes, faucets, thermostats, and water pumps from first principles.</p>
      <p> The article was saying that the software and web development industries were moving toward the plumber model which seemed to me a division of labor built on more standardized platforms. As tools at different levels of the process become easier to manage and also more diverse to suit the needs of each craftsperson less depth of understanding is necessary to get projects off the ground.  This was said to actually increase teh ability of the engineer from 10x productivity to the possibility of a one engineer company worth a billion dollars. It also expressed the idea that people with software or web application ideas may come from a broader and broader community.  The article gave the feeling that development is moving towards the IKEA model. Picking the pieces you need with no experience necessary.</p>
