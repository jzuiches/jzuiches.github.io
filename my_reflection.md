## 3. [Web Basics](3_web_basics/readme.md) Reflection

* What 2 new things did you learn about the web?
* What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site?
* How did you feel when you saw your web page live?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

The two new things I learned about the web are that the internet is the infrastructure and the web are the actual sites.  I also know now the difference between a web page and a web app.  A web page just sits there and a web app is more interactive.  So it must maintain a database. Still not sure what a database is beside a large file of data.

Some important things to remember when setting up a HTML site is to use <> when coding and all the other coding letters and symbols.  That the website will get a 404 error until its up on the web, maybe 10 minutes.

I haven't yet been able to find my website.  I thought it was the 10 minute delay but it appears to be something else.

I was very happy that I found this page for my reflections.  That I found the repo in my files and then opened it with sublime text. 

Not yet.
