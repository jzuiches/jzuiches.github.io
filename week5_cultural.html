      <h4>Feedback</h4>
      <p> Feedback is a big part of DBC. I agree with their philosophy that it is a fundamental, if not the fundamental, part of learning.  This idea creates for me an image of learning as a young person walking down the street and being told by others, some trusted and some not, to go this way and not that, guiding our young wayfarer to his or her goal or atleast keeping her from the perils and missteps that the initiates have found.  This seems to me a good or useful eay of thinking about learning. It speaks to the contextual nature of learning away from the aperic vision of one contemplating the forms from a mountaintop or I usually come to the idea of learning with some preconcieved ideas.  One of the assumptions I make that I've had for a while is that learning in a sense is mor of a realizing or an uncovering of what already is. Learning and education is a consummer product similar if not the same as other consummer goods.  It is purchased. You fill yourself with what you need to get yourself to the goals that you have determined or others have determined for you.  This flies in the face of another fundamental metaphor DBC promulgates, that of the kitchen or dining room vision of the classroom.  This is a beautiful image of participitory as opposed to consumptive methods of learning. Now like most things I don't believe that one is right and the other wrong. There is a normal desire to be on the side of the right especially if it seem against the common sense of the day. If you feel that you have some secret knowledge especially secret knowledge than can usurps the powers that be.  The revolutionary thought becomes as or more dogmatic and evangelical as any dominant mode agreed or succumbed to by the majority.</p>
      <p> I'd like to get back to the idea of feedback and preternatural understanding.  There are methods adn modes and phycological constructions that are human. Many times when scientist talk about quantum mechanics and the paradoxes and difficulties every student, nay every human runs into is explained as an inability of our mind to do the gymnastics required. That our minds have evolved for other purposes.  Purposes closer to procuring food an not getting kills by all the other dangers of the wild world.  This all seems reasonable and somewhat beyond that is the structures that have evolved in conjunction with our mind for example the morphology of our bodies the stuctures of our eyes and ears and guts.  The mind has not evolved in a vacuum.  There is nothing called pure sense perception.  So much comes before, and after, that what we "know" is an understanding of structures of ourselves as the "eye" of perception moves outward and inward from it's purely metaphorical center sometimes named the self.</p>
